- This Shinyapp demonstrates some of the basic concepts of classical genetics, which can be used as a teaching and learning tool. In the current beta version, the app can do the following:

- Takes user input of strings as genotypes for parents

- Uses the inputted parental genotype information to determine whether the loci are heterozygous or homozygous for the alleles.

- Uses the inputted parental genotype information to generate the possible unique gamete(s) each parent can produce.

- Enables the user to make a cross between the parents to generate a Punnett square containing the genotypes of all progenies ensuing from the cross.

- Gives a tabular summary of the unique genotypes in the Punnett square and their expected genotype frequencies.

- Assuming complete dominance at each locus, the app allows users to visualize hypotheses about gene interactions and their phenotypic predictions. 

- Specifically, the app uses different colors to highlight individuals in the Punnett square that would exhibit the same phenotype under a given gene interaction hypothesis. 

- Currently, phenotypic predictions for gene interaction hypotheses on independent assortment and classical digenic epistatic interactions can be visualized in the app.
